Welcome to PipeNetCalc, a tool designed to make pipe network calculations as accessible and convenient as possible for everyone.

My name is Maxim, and I am a 5th year student at the Faculty of Mathematics of Kuban State University. This project is the culmination of my academic journey and passion for applied mathematics and programming. During my studies, I became fascinated by the possibility of using mathematical algorithms to solve real engineering problems and this led to the creation of PipeNetCalc, my graduation project.

PipeNetCalc is the result of many months of research and development, the goal of which was to create a tool that can simplify and automate the process of calculating pipe network parameters. What makes this tool so special is that it is simple and accessible to non-experts, yet powerful enough to be useful to experienced engineers and subject matter experts.

PipeNetCalc's mission is to provide reliable and accurate calculations, saving you time and resources. I hope that this application will prove to be a valuable resource for students, engineers, and the academic and professional community.
